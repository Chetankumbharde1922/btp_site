Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide in both men and women. Most lung cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the symptoms (i.e., cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, pain in the thorax) appear and this often leads to a poor prognosis. Various methods in the past have been taken into use but none have met standards of simultaneous speed detection and accuracy. With the growing age of technology and continuous urge to build and use things that are effective to use and also easy enough to operate, we need a diagnostic technique that can detect lungs cancer at an early stage.

In recent times VOC’s [Volatile organic compounds] have been identified to show a richer presence in the respiratory tract of an affected person compared to that of a healthy person. These VOCs can be detected using various sensors to mark the prediction of the presence/absence of lung cancer in the study. So we have compiled the list of VOC’s from different research articles on one platform and to make it accessible to everyone.
